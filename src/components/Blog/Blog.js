                <div className="ans bg-info p-4">
                    <p>Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.</p>
                    <p>NoSQL databases like MongoDB are a good choice when your data is document-centric and doesn't fit well into the schema of a relational database, when you need to accommodate massive scale, when you are rapidly prototyping, and a few other use cases.</p>

                    <p>SQL is relational database management system (RDBMS).These databases have fixed or static or predefined schema.These databases are not suited for hierarchical data storage.These databases are best suited for complex queries</p>
                    <p>Non-relational or distributed database system.They have dynamic schema.These databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage.These databases are not so good for complex queries</p>

                    <p>JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties — a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.</p>
